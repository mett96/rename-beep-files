# Rename Beep File
This small script removes all the `+` characters and replaces them with a space contained in the file name.

It is a very simple tool but very useful when directly downloading zip files from folders from the [Beep site](https://beep.metid.polimi.it).
## Instructions

Download the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mett96/rename-beep-files.git
```

Execute the `main.py` file.

```python
python3 main.py
```

You may include the path of the target folder directly into the execution of the file, otherwise you will be asked by the program, the target folder.

```python
python3 main.py path_to_target_folder
```
